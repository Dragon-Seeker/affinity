Peeved by the limits of the [Stone Banded Aethum Flux Node](^affinity:aethum_flux#2) (low conduction rates and a measly
5 links at most), you develop a much-improved derivative.


The first of the problems is solved easily enough through the use of [Attuned Amethyst Shards](^affinity:shard_attunement).
Indeed, using a more refined shard also {concept}boosts the maximum conduction range{}.

The latter, it turns out, is mended using a more... crude approach. Simply through {concept}inserting an array of
auxiliary{} {item}unattuned Amethyst Shards{}, suspended around the center conductor, {concept}5 extra devices per
shard{} can be joined.
