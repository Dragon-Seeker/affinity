While out and about in the caves, you might notice an irregularity in the rock which looks a little something like this:

<block;affinity:peculiar_clump>

Such {item}Peculiar Clumps{} exhibit bizarre behavior: when mined,

;;;;;

they frequently disintegrate without leaving a trace.


This property is shown to manifest due to the {concept}high concentration of {}{item}Anthracite{}
(a principal {concept}Aethum conductor{}) in these boulders, causing them to quickly shatter when impacted from an
improper angle.


A highly sensitive piece of equipment is required to...

...discern the stable side - the {item}Geological Resonator{}.

<recipe;affinity:assembly/geological_resonator>

When used on the {concept}stable side{}, the integrated pitchfork will resonate and {concept}give off a characteristic 
ring{}.


Once this information is obtained, your pickaxe need

;;;;;

only be {concept}pointed at the stable side{} while mining and the clump will give up its contents.


Among these, there is always some {item}Anthracite Powder{} and sometimes some more valuable gems. To improve these
chances and the amount of minerals extracted, {concept}Fortune{} has proven useful.
