When inspecting a [Wisp](^affinity:wisps), it quickly becomes obvious that it made of more than just its {item}Matter{}.
Indeed, using a {item}Glass Bottle{}, the Wisp's {item}Mist{} can be collected. Just like {item}Wisp Matter{}, it comes
in the three variants of {concept}inert, vicious and wise{} - determined by the Wisp it was collected from.


Besides a small number of applications in the construction of magical

artifacts, {item}Wisp Mist{} appears to also be of significant use in the practice of {concept}brewing{}.


To be precise, {item}Wisp Mist{} {concept}boosts any potion's level to III{} when applied to that potion's respective
{concept}level II variant{} in a {item}Brewing Stand{} - resulting in a {concept}Misty Potion{}.
