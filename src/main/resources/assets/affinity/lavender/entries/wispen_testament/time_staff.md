Time, perhaps the most essential mystery of the universe, is frequently of the essence. Taking control of it would be,
to put it lightly, desirable.


While the {item}Time Staff{}, one of the most powerful instruments ever conceived and produced, does not grant full
authority over time just yet, it does enable {concept}localized acceleration{} of its forward flow.

When used, the {item}Time Staff{} accelerates the flow of time for its targeted block by the factor configured - for a
significant [Aethum](^affinity:aethum) cost.

@staff-pedestal
When anchored on a [Staff Pedestal](^affinity:staff_pedestal), it behaves mostly the same - except that the higher power density available
through the supplied [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) lets it affect a great number of blocks. Indeed, the flow of

time is accelerated by the configured factor (which, while on a pedestal, can be changed by sneak-scrolling while
looking at the pedestal) in a closed box extending about {concept}2 blocks{} in the cardinal directions.
