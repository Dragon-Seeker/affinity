The innate [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) conduction of {item}Amethyst Shards{} can be improved upon
through {concept}attuning infusion{}.

This process, conducted through the [Aspen Infusion](^affinity:aspen_infusion), can be repeated {concept}up to three
times{} and produces shards with both a {concept}higher{}...

...{concept}maximum conduction rate{} and {concept}distance{}. A prime application of these improved shards lies in the
[Copper Plated Aethum Flux Node](^affinity:copper_plated_aethum_flux_node).
