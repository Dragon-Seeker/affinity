It should come as little surprise that [Wisp Matter](^affinity:wisps) {concept}decomposes into{}
[Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) when appropriately stimulated.


For this purpose, a simple device like the readily constructed {item}Matter Harvesting Hearth{} suffices. Built from
fundamental, common materials and {concept}requiring no further setup{}, it makes for a fine

<recipe;affinity:assembly/matter_harvesting_hearth>

starter generator. After crafting, it must only be {concept}placed down and some Wisp Matter inserted{}. To maintain a
steady production rate, a {item}Hopper{} might prove useful.

It is also to note that {concept}differing types{} of {item}Wisp Matter{} release {concept}differing amounts of
Aethum Flux{}. This amount is indicated when inspecting the {item}Matter Harvesting Hearth{} with the respective type of
{item}Wisp Matter{} inserted.


In this respect, {item}Vicious Wisp Matter{} performs the best and {item}Inert Wisp Matter{} the worst.
