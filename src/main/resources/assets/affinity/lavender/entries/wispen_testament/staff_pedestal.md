The various [Staffs](^affinity:staff_prototyping) are no doubt very useful tools - only hindered by the need for somebody
to wield them.


You devise the {item}Staff Pedestal{} to alleviate this precise problem. A simple receptacle for a staff, suspending it
in midair, it provides the staff with [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) to operate.


It turns out, however, that the use of {concept}Aethum Flux{} over

;;;;;

<recipe;affinity:assembly/staff_pedestal>

the wielder's {concept}Aethum{} to power the staff {concept}alters its behavior{}.


In general, a staff's function when installed on a {item}Staff Pedestal{} is {concept}similar but not identical{} to
its behavior...

...when used manually - observe each staff's respective notes to learn the specifics.


It should also be of interest that, since most if not all staffs affect a certain area around the
{item}Staff Pedestal{}, the [Wand of Inquiry](^affinity:inquiry) can be used to visualize the area-of-effect of
whichever staff is installed on a {item}Staff Pedestal{} at a given time.
