Re-combining a {concept}Vicious Wisp's{} [Mist](^affinity:wisp_mist) with its [Matter](^affinity:wisps#7) doesn't quite
restore it back to life - but it does let the {item}Arboreal Annihilation Apparatus{} use the Wisp's ray of destruction.


Using this power, it {concept}ruthlessly annihilates any and all trees{} in close proximity. The emancipated leaves and

trace, except the [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) which gets distilled directly into the apparatus.


Great care is advised when installing the {item}Arboreal Annihilation Apparatus{} - visualizing
the endangered area with the [Wand of Inquiry](^affinity:inquiry#3) is recommended.
