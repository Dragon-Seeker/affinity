The {concept}Graviton{}, an as-yet merely partially-understood fundamental particle, plays an important role in the
{item}Shulker's{} levitation abilities.


Of particular interest are its bullets, which carry a large capacity of these particles and are intrinsically coupled
to the {item}Shulker's{} life - making them a perfect candidate for [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) extraction.

Through a range of reactions, some physical and some magical in nature, the {item}Graviton Transducer{} is able to
{concept}obtain a superb quantity of Aethum Flux{} from a single {item}Shulker Bullet{} - once its gets in range.
The bullet, naturally, {concept}is destroyed{} as a result.


Required for this technique to work is a catalyst, for which the {item}Graviton Transducer{} employs
[Attuned Amethyst Shards](^affinity:shard_attunement). Since the molecular structure of the

;;;;;

shard in the transducer deteriorates with each bullet processed, it {concept}must be replaced from time to time{}.


Further, the amount of {concept}Aethum Flux{} obtained from each processed {item}Shulker Bullet{} depends on the quality
of the shard's attunement - {concept}the higher, the better{}.
