As is to be expected given that [Aethum](^affinity:aethum) is, at its core, no more than yet another expression of
energy, it can be concentrated to form the rather lethal {concept}Aethum Missiles{}. These homing projectiles, when colliding
with their target, directly attack its {concept}Aethum{} and deal damage which {concept}bypasses armor, enchantments{}
and the {concept}short-term invulnerability{} awarded after a hit.

Unsurprisingly, the {item}Salvo Staff{} is used to conjure them in quick salvos of 3, using its innate
{item}Quick Charge III{} enchantment.

To attack with it, aim at the desired target, {concept}begin using the staff{} to lock in the target and keep holding
the use key for as long as you want it to keep firing.


Note that the delay between salvos {concept}cannot be skipped{} by stopping and restarting the use cycle - in fact, this
incurs a longer delay.
