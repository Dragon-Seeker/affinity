A kind of tool as versatile as it is iconic, being able to construct {concept}Staffs{} is surely a rather critical
skill. To this end, the {item}Staff Prototype{} forms the fundamental step.


Constructed from the [Aethum](^affinity:aethum)-affine {item}Azalea Wood{} and an {item}Amethyst Shard{} at its core,
it provides an intricate yet sturdy basis upon which a proper staff can be realized.

This process, known as {concept}specialization{}, can take many forms - from elementary
[Assembly](^affinity:assembly_augment) to elaborate [ritualistic infusion](^affinity:conducting_rituals). In all cases,
a {item}Staff Prototype{} is refined and adjusted to carry out a particular, specific function.
