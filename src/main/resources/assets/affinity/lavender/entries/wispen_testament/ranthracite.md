{i}Ranthracite Wire{}, created by placing {i}Ranthracite Dust{}, is shown to be an excellent conductor of {c}Redstone
signals{}. Yet, being an infusion of [Anthracite Powder](^affinity:anthracite_extraction) and {i}Redstone Dust{}, it
shows two most strange properties:

- Unlike the {i}Redstone Wire{} in its ancestry, {i}Ranthracite Wire{} {c}runs along the bottom of blocks{} instead of
  the top

<recipe;affinity:aspen_infusion/ranthracite_dust>

- Presumably a side effect of {i}Anthracite's{} excellent [Aethum](^affinity:aethum)-conductivity, {i}Ranthracite Wire{}
  perfectly preserves signal strength over indefinite distances
