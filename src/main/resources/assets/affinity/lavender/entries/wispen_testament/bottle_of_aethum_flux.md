While the more sophisticated technology of an [Aethum Flux Cache](^affinity:aethum_flux#6) is most certainly required to
safely contain larger quantities of it, a humble {item}Glass Bottle{} suffices to store a small sample of it.


As such, {concept}using a {item}Glass Bottle{}{} on an {item}Aethum Flux Cache{} {concept}filled with at least 1000
Aethum Flux{} extracts this quantity into a {item}Bottle of Aethum Flux{} - reinsertion

;;;;;

follows the same procedure.


Mostly useless on its own (if maybe pretty to look at), it does have an interesting
interaction with {item}Flowering Azalea Leaves{}. Exposing them to this sample of {concept}Aethum Flux{} by simply
{concept}using the bottle on them{} deepens their color and turns them into {item}Unflowering Azalea Leaves{}. True
to their name, this more volatile form {concept}evaporates all flowers and grass{} in a {concept}16-block radius{}
when {concept}sneak-interacted{} with an empty hand.
