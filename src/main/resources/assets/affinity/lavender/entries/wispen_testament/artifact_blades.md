One particularly useful application of [ritualistic infusion](^affinity:conducting_rituals) is reviving the ancient,
long-forgotten art of {c}magical sword-making{}. More than a mere stabbing device, the thus-manufactured {i}Forgotten
Artifact Blade{} possesses remarkable strength and accuracy alongside grand potential for future upgrades. Still, even
this most basic blade has an {c}active ability{} activated by

{c}using the item{} while {c}holding the attack key{}. While active, as indicated by the {c}blue item bar{}, the blade
gains {c}2 additional points of damage{}.

A Warden's [Resonance Crystal](^affinity:resonance_crystal), obtained using the blade, allows further refining and
stabilizing its magical properties. An infusion process alongside a sturdy {i}Diamond{} base ultimately results in the
{i}Stabilized Artifact Blade{}.


Besides increased base damage, this brings with it two major enhancements. For

one, the damage dealt {c}while the ability is active{} is now {c}armor-piercing{}. Further, while the blade is held,
{c}[Aethum](^affinity:aethum) regenerates 15% quicker{}.

By employing [Spirit Assimilation](^affinity:spirit_assimilation), the blade can be further strengthened using materials
from {c}the Nether{} - including the soul of a {i}Blaze{}.


This, besides further improving all existing aspect of the weapon, adds a new facet to the active ability. That is, when
performing an attack after {c}falling more{}...

...{c}than two blocks{}, attack damage {c}increases with fall distance{} and {c}splashes outward{} to damage foes (and
friends, if care is not applied) in a large area.


Additionally, the larger yet strangely lighter blade swings far more easily - thus enabling an {c}increase in overall
attack speed{}.

The final tier of {c}Artifact Blade{} obtainable through normal means is the {i}Superior Artifact Blade{}. Combining
artifacts obtained from a beast in each major dimension, it improves significantly upon all aspects of its predecessor
to make a well-rounded final blade.
