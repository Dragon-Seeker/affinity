Introducing the Aethum-affine properties of an {item}Amethyst Shard{} into the proven mechanism of a {item}Redstone
Comparator{}, it appears, lets the resulting appliance {concept}compare and measure the Aethum of its surroundings{}.


In particular, if the detected presence of Aethum is {concept}stronger than the device's threshold{}, it will 
{concept}output a strong Redstone signal{}.

<recipe;affinity:assembly/aethum_probe>

This threshold can be lowered by {concept}installing additional {item}Amethyst Shards{} onto the probe{} while placed down, 
increasing its sensitivity.
