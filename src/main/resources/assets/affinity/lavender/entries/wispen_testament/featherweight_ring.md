Combining the effects of a {item}Potion of Slow Falling{} and the spirit of a chicken as provided by the {item}Feathers{},
the {item}Featherweight Ring{} effectively reduces the effects of gravity on the wearer, {concept}granting 3 extra blocks
of fall resistance{}.


This means that, unlike the average being, the wearer will start to [{concept}get hurt{}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Hurt)
{concept} after 6 blocks over the usual 3{}.

Do note, however, that the same airy properties which increase fall resistance also {concept}increase knockback
susceptibility{}, having the wearer get flung noticeably farther than usual.
