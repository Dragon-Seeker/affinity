The supremum (plural suprema; abbreviated sup, eg. sup(B)) of a subset S of a partially ordered set P is the least element in P that
is greater than or equal to each element of S, if such an element exists. In other words, it is the least element of P
that is greater than or equal to the greatest element of S. Consequently, the supremum is also referred to as the least
upper bound.
